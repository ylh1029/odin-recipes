# odin-recipes
This is my first practice on learning to use Git and GitHub. 
This web page will be on recipes but really, it'll be a bunch of random things so please don't bother to read through. 
Nothing major will be established from this project. I already know HTML well enough to not spend a ton of time on this particular project.
